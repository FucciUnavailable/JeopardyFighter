# 2D Fighter Game

This is a 2D fighting game built using **JavaScript** and **HTML5 Canvas**. The game features two fighters with distinct movements and attacks, as well as health management. The player controls a fighter using keyboard inputs to perform different actions such as walking, jumping, attacking, and getting hit.

This project demonstrates my skills in **game development**, **object-oriented programming**, and **JavaScript animation**. It will be part of my portfolio to showcase my proficiency in web development and game mechanics, with the goal of securing a job as a **Software Engineer** or **Full Stack Developer**.
